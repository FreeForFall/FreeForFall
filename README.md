# Repository guidelines
This is the repository for our awesome game.
There are 5 branches : master, Alex, Corentin, Nicolas, Stan.

Do NOT edit anything that is not in YOUR branch. 

If ANY error pops up, please send a message to the github dictator, we don't want the whole repo to crash.

To start editing your branch, use
````
git rebase master
git checkout branch_name
```
Once you have made the changes expected, commit and message the github dictator. 
```
git commit --all -m "Commit message"
```
If you have created files in the process, add them, and then commit.
```
git add path/to/file
git commit --all -m "Commit message"
```
Merging into will be handled by the github dictator. (For now, at least)
