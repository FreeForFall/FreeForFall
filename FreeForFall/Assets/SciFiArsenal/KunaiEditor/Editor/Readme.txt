Thank you for purchasing Kunai Editor!

We hope this editor will make your particle system editing effecient and enjoyable.

Features
------------------------

- Scale Particle Systems
- Scale child particle systems
- Scale all particle Systems/child particle Systems within a folder at once.
- You can Change start colors of one or multiple particle systems.
- You can add rotations to your particle systems.

------------------------
How to Use
------------------------
1. You can access the Kunai Editor in the Windows tab (Windows>Kunai Editor).

2. Simply drag & drop the folder or prefab you want to scale.

3. Type in or scroll the Scale Multiplier to your wanted level.

4. Press "Set Scale" to test the new scale. You have now scaled your particle systems, if you wish to save a copy of their new
   scale, you can type in a new name in the "Copy Suffix" and press Save Copy.

There are also options to mass-change the Start Color as well as adding a custom rotation script to your particle systems.

------------------------
Please Note
------------------------

- The Kunai Editor will NOT effect the colors of particle systems that use the Gradient color system.
- Please use the "Exit" button to close the window. The "X" button at the top right will not properly
  reset your original prefabs to their original variables.
- Note that you must enter a suffix to save a copy of your newly scaled particle system.
- Applying a rotation to your particle systems gameObject will add the KunaiRotation component to your gameobject.
