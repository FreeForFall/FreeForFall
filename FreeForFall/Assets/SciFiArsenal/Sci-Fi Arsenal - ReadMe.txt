Sci-Fi Arsenal
------------------

To use the effects, you need to import the SciFi Arsenal folder to your project.

There are also some folders (and sub-folders) which are not required for the effects to work:

"InteractiveDemo" - This contains the web demo as linked to on the Asset Store. 

"KunaiEditor" - This is a tool that lets you scale multiple particle effects at once.

"Sci-Fi Textures" - A teaser pack of sci-fi textures used for the web demo. The full pack is available on the Asset Store.

F.A.Q.:
------------------

Q: I'm getting "AABB" errors when testing the demo or importing the effects to my project!

A: There is a bug with some of Unity 5.3 versions, and can be fixed by updating to 5.3.1p2 or later versions.

-

Q: I think this pack is missing something / This pack doesn't have an effect like this!

A: If you have any suggestions for additional content, feel free to send me an e-mail, and it might just be featured in the next version.

-

Q: My projectile effect isn't working properly!

A: Some of the projectile effects only emit particles when they are moving, so you will have to put it in motion to get the full effect.

-

Q: My impact effects rotation is odd! 
A: Some of the impact effects default rotation is set to impact at a floor. This means you will have to script the impact effect to be rotated according to the surface direction.

-

Q: Can you help me with coding?
A: I am unfortunately not a very skilled programmer, but you can get help at Unity Answers: http://answers.unity3d.com/
